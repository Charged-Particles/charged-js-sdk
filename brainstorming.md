## Minimum Viable Product (Alpha)

- target devs for alpha
  - already comfortable with Web3 and/or Ethers
  - not your first Web3 Dapp project
  - Rarible / other NFT teams
  - Hackathon devs
  - people who want to enhance existing NFT projects / ideas

- must-have functions
  - **read NFT's wallet balance**

## Medium term goals
  - energize, withdraw, discharge

## Long-term goals

- use our own SDK for new dapps we develop as a core team
- deploy new custom contracts like Rarible
- implement our own SDK into our dapp in small steps?
  - SDK for homepage as first step?

## Design Decisions

- Follow the OpenAPI standard: https://swagger.io/specification/
  - standard Schema and formatting
- Work in TypeScript (loosely typed at first, then create stricter typing as we go)
